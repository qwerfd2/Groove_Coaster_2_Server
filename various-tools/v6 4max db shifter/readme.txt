Between 4MAX expansion 6 and 7, 70+ extra levels were added, that includes some AC Alternate charts that were inserted into slots without AC difficulties, due to the 1000 song hard limit.

Within those 10+ AC Alt levels are 3 levels that were previously part of the 4MAX expansion. Their song ID were shifted to provide space for other songs.

As a result, those three song's score needs to be shifted in the database (song ID 918 > 7, 921 > 4, 722 > 10).

Furthermore, it was discovered that a song has been duplicated. It has been deleted and all score after it must be shifted (song ID 359)

This script does that, simply place in the server root directory and run it.

Everyone with 4max expansion installed needs to run it. If you are just setting the whole things up, this is not required.
